## Summative Assessment 1 

The project that I have decided to pick is the gesture recognition system, where if the user makes a certain gesture, the AI model will perform an action in the smart home. The list of the gestures and the potential actions are as follows: <br/>

Open palm: Turn on lights <br/>
Closed fist: Turn off lights <br/>
Peace sign: Play/pause music <br/>
Ok sign: Activate security system <br/>
L sign: Increase Air Conditioning temperature <br/>
Three fingers up: Turn on fan <br/>
Four fingers up: Lock all doors <br/>
